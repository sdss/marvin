===================

[2.3.0] - 2018/?/?
--------------------

Added
^^^^^
- Added cheatsheet to docs.
- New Web authentication using Flask-Login
- New API authentication using Flask-JWT-Extended
- Adds MPL-7 / DR15 datamodel
- New config.access attribute indicating public or collab access
- New config.login method to handle token-based login
- New marvin.yml config file for customization of configuration options
- Adds User table into the history schema of mangadb.  Tracks user logins.
- ``Map`` has a new method ``getSpaxel`` to retrieve an ``Spaxel`` using the parent ``Maps``.
- New configuration option in ``marvin.yml``, ``default_release``, to set the release to be used when Marvin gets imported (:issue:`463`).

Changed
^^^^^^^
- Integrated datamodel plotting params into actual datamodel structures
- Moved netrc checks into the Brain
- Expanded sasurl into public and collab urls
- Changes personal emails to sdss helpdesk email in web
- Added rawsql and return_params columns to history.query table in mangadb
- Extra keyword arguments passed to ``Spectrum.plot`` are now forwarded to ``Axes.plot``.
- Tools (e.g., ``Cube``, ``Maps``) can now be accessed from the ``marvin`` namespace (e.g., ``marvin.tools.Cube`` or ``marvin.tools.cube.Cube``).
- Moved ``yanny.py`` to ``extern/`` and added a readme file for the external packages (:issue:`468`).
- `~marvin.tools.quantities.Spectrum.plot` now only masks part of the spectrum that have the ``DONOTUSE`` maskbit set (:issue:`455`).
- ``pixmask`` is now available for all quantities (except ``AnalysisProprty``). The property ``masked`` now uses the bit ``DONOTUSE`` to determine what values must be masked out (:issue:`462`).

- Bugfix - Python 3 xrange syntax bug in buildImageDict
- ``Bin._create_spaxels`` instantiating spaxels with the wrong ``(i,j)`` values for the bin. The ``(i, j)`` values from the ``binid`` map were being swapped twice before sending them to ``SpaxelBase`` (:issue:`457`).
- A bug in the calculation of the deredden inverse variance in a `~marvin.tools.quantities.datacube.DataCube`.

Refactored
^^^^^^^^^^
- Moved `marvin.core.core` to `marvin.tools.core` and split the mixins into `marvin.tools.mixins`.

   github issue inclusion
-  Updated all Marvin tests to turn off Sentry exception catching and
   the github message

   -  adds hatching for regions with data (i.e., a spectrum) but no
      measurement by the DAP

      -  cmap is RdBu_r (diverging) for velocity plots (Note: this is
         reversed from the sense of the default coolwarm colormap in
         v2.0---red for positive velocities and blue for negative
         velocities)
      -  cmap is inferno (sequential) for sigma plots
      -  clips at 5th and 95th percentiles
      -  clips at 10th and 90th percentiles for velocity and sigma plots
      -  velocity plots are symmetric about 0
