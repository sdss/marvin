Marvin Documentation
====================

Marvin is a tool specifically designed to visualise and analyse `MaNGA <https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/>`_ data. It is developed and maintained by the MaNGA team. Marvin allows you to:

* Access reduced MaNGA datacubes local, remotely, or via a `web interface <https://dr16.sdss.org/marvin>`_.
* Access and visualise data analysis products.
* Perform powerful queries on data and metadata.
* Abstract the datamodel and forget where the data actually lives.
* Make good visualisation and scientific decisions by preventing common mistakes when accessing the data.

.. To install marvin simply run ``pip install sdss-marvin``. More details and known problem with installation can be found :ref:`here <marvin-installation>`.

.. note:: This documentation assumes that you are familiar with MaNGA data and its acronyms. If that is not your case, consider reading `this <https://www.sdss.org/dr16/manga/getting-started/>`_.

.. warning:: As of June 2024, the Marvin Web and API have been migrated to a new server home.
   ``sdss-marvin >= 2.8.2`` has been updated to reflect this change.  Please update to the latest package version.
   For package versions ``<= 2.8.1``, please see this :ref:`Workaround <marvin-server-workaround>`
